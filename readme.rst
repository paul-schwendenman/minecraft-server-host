Minecraft Server Host
----------------------

This repository contains the blueprint for creating
an automated and configurable minecraft server on-demand.

The project provides a webapp that can be used to start an ec2
instance which has been configured to run a minecraft server.
The instance will automatically shutdown after five minutes if
no players are online to help to reduce costs.
